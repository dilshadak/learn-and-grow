W e know that flowing\\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\\nsay that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we\\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\\nflow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e\\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\\nmetallic wir es, electr ons constitute the flow of char ges. However , electr ons\\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was t'),\n",

       "' and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\\ncross-section ( A). That is,\\nR ∝ l (11.8)\\nand R ∝ 1/A (11.9)\\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\\nR ∝ l\\nA\\nor, R = ρl\\nA(11.10)\\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\\nresistivity of the material of the conductor . The SI unit of resistivity is\\nΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material.
